        <p>Turn Touch is a beautiful remote control carved out of solid wood. This project consists of multiple parts of software, hardware, materials, and manufacturing. An epic undertaking culminating in a Kickstarter campaign in March 2017 that resulting in nearly a thousand remotes sold to 645 backers. </p>
        
        <p>Using Turn Touch solves the problem of controlling all the smart devices and apps in your home. Interacting with a home full of smart lights and smart devices often involves pulling out your phone or buying a voice assistant and verbalizing repetitive commands. Four buttons mapped to all sort of functionality is a faster and more seamless experience of living in the future.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>The idea came to me in a flash back in 2013. While driving the 101 near Mountain View the idea of Turn Touch popped into my head, fulfilling my desire to control music and video on my iMac while also controlling my Hue lights. </p>
        
        <p>Not only would this be a four button remote capable of interacting with all things WiFi, but it would be carved out of solid wood. It would fit into my home in the same way a piece of furniture makes a room more inviting. A natural looking wireless gadget that wouldn't detract from the warmth of a living room.</p>
        
        <img src="turntouch-cad.png" class="u-max-full-width photo">
        
        <p>But to build it I had to learn all of the tools that are part of building hardware. There's a lot involved in building this remote: designing a circuit board and choosing a wireless chip, writing reliable and upgradeable firmware, 3D printing prototypes, injection molding for manufacturing, CAD and CAM for machining varieties of hardwood, and laser cutting mother of pearl for an inlay. I wanted to build a piece that would be museum quality yet something anyone could afford.</p>
        
        <p>This was a solo project where I was responsible for designing, prototyping, and redesigning each component. It was a laborious process because not only did I have to make a handful of prototypes but I also needed to design each component to be manufacturable in quantities up to 10,000. That meant creating an assembly process where everything seamlessly came together and clicked into place. </p>

            <div class="columns seven">
                <img src="turntouch-cnc1.gif" class="u-max-full-width photo">

            <div class="columns five">

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Above is an example of the iterative process in designing a process for reliably machining the wood. On the left is a vise clamp with a single wood blank held tightly, oriented with the help of a level. The benefit of this fixture is that no fixture has to be built and off-the-shelf components can be used. However, the drawbacks are enormous. To start, due to the manual nature of positioning and registering the wood blank, it has a large margin of error. It also requires tabs to hold the model in place while it's being machined. These tabs then need to be manually sanded off, which is laborious and often inaccurate as the contour shape needs to be maintained.</p>
        
        <p>On the right is the evolution of the machining fixture. The thinking that goes into building this fixture involves finding solutions to each of the older fixtures problems. There are numerous benefits of this fixture. To start, it can machine dozens of remotes at once. It is also far more accurate as it only require a surfaced wood board to be placed and held down in one spot, as sopposed to the manual and often inaccurate positioning of the vise clamp. It also disposes of the tabs through the use of vacuum holes that hold down the remote while it is processed through two sided machining.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>A key concern in building these manufacturing tools is that it only uses off-the-shelf components and can be reassembled in less than a day on site at the factory. It keeps costs low while opening up the freedom to perform the factory work anywhere.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>Graduating from machining one remote at a time to 30 took a few steps. An iterative and evolving process that involved some trial-and-error and some noodling resulted in the manufacturing ready process you see above.</p>

        <p>Through open-source hardware like Turn Touch, I’m working to lower the barrier to entry when it comes to creating and manufacturing your own complex hardware devices. Sure, it’s not what you might call a “traditional business plan”. But I strongly believe that by helping other people use the same tools I use, our community of makers gets larger and more inventive.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, when more than one person places their hand upon the pulse sensors, the stem starts to pulse with both participants’ heartbeats, making it possible to watch how heart rates of diffrent people in intimate spaces start to beat in sync, much like fireflies flashing in patterns.</p>

        <p>Grove is a set of 10 interactive biofeedback sculptures, a conversation between humans and trees. Each tree is made of steel tubes, thousands of LEDs, and custom breathing sensors. Grove was a 2016 honorarium installation at Burning Man.</p>
        
        <p>Here’s how Grove works: you sit down at the base of a tree and a flower opens up in front of you as it senses your presence. As you breathe into a pink flower lit from inside, the tree fills up with your breath, rising white streams overtaking multiple slowly descending green lines. As you breathe, the tree shimmers with light as it becomes a nighttime desert oasis.</p>
