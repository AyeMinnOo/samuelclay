        <p>Turn Touch is a beautiful remote control carved out of solid wood. This project consists of multiple parts of software, hardware, materials, and manufacturing. An epic undertaking culminating in a Kickstarter campaign in March 2017 that resulting in nearly a thousand remotes sold to 645 backers. </p>
        
        <p>Using Turn Touch solves the problem of controlling all the smart devices and apps in your home. Interacting with a home full of smart lights and smart devices often involves pulling out your phone or buying a voice assistant and verbalizing repetitive commands. Four buttons mapped to all sort of functionality is a faster and more seamless experience of living in the future.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>The idea came to me in a flash back in 2013. While driving the 101 near Mountain View the idea of Turn Touch popped into my head, fulfilling my desire to control music and video on my iMac while also controlling my Hue lights. </p>
        
        <p>Not only would this be a four button remote capable of interacting with all things WiFi, but it would be carved out of solid wood. It would fit into my home in the same way a piece of furniture makes a room more inviting. A natural looking wireless gadget that wouldn't detract from the warmth of a living room.</p>
        
        <img src="turntouch-cad.png" class="u-max-full-width photo">
        
        <p>But to build it I had to learn all of the tools that are part of building hardware. There's a lot involved in building this remote: designing a circuit board and choosing a wireless chip, writing reliable and upgradeable firmware, 3D printing prototypes, injection molding for manufacturing, CAD and CAM for machining varieties of hardwood, and laser cutting mother of pearl for an inlay. I wanted to build a piece that would be museum quality yet something anyone could afford.</p>
        
        <p>This was a solo project where I was responsible for designing, prototyping, and redesigning each component. It was a laborious process because not only did I have to make a handful of prototypes but I also needed to design each component to be manufacturable in quantities up to 10,000. That meant creating an assembly process where everything seamlessly came together and clicked into place. </p>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="columns seven">
                <img src="turntouch-cnc1.gif" class="u-max-full-width photo">

        </div>
        
        <p>Above is an example of the iterative process in designing a process for reliably machining the wood. On the left is a vise clamp with a single wood blank held tightly, oriented with the help of a level. The benefit of this fixture is that no fixture has to be built and off-the-shelf components can be used. However, the drawbacks are enormous. To start, due to the manual nature of positioning and registering the wood blank, it has a large margin of error. It also requires tabs to hold the model in place while it's being machined. These tabs then need to be manually sanded off, which is laborious and often inaccurate as the contour shape needs to be maintained.</p>
        
        <p>On the right is the evolution of the machining fixture. The thinking that goes into building this fixture involves finding solutions to each of the older fixtures problems. There are numerous benefits of this fixture. To start, it can machine dozens of remotes at once. It is also far more accurate as it only require a surfaced wood board to be placed and held down in one spot, as sopposed to the manual and often inaccurate positioning of the vise clamp. It also disposes of the tabs through the use of vacuum holes that hold down the remote while it is processed through two sided machining.</p>

        <p>A key concern in building these manufacturing tools is that it only uses off-the-shelf components and can be reassembled in less than a day on site at the factory. It keeps costs low while opening up the freedom to perform the factory work anywhere.</p>

        <p>Graduating from machining one remote to thirty at a time took a few steps. An iterative and evolving process that involved some trial-and-error and some noodling resulted in the production ready manufacturing process you see above.</p>
        
        <img src="turntouch-laser.gif" class="u-full-width photo">
        
        <p>There's a flourish on the bottom of every remote. It's mother of pearl inlayed directly into the wood. This delightful and tasteful addition also serves as the only visible branding on the remote.</p>
        
        <p>The process used to inlay the mother of pearl shell involves a laser cutter and an alignment fixture, reliably producing perfect engravings and cutouts.</p>
        
        <img src="turntouch-mop.jpeg" class="u-max-full-width photo">
        
        <p>Soldering is at the heart of electronics design. Learning how to solder with hot air and reflow techniques, coupled with board stencils and steady hands, was crucial to designing a better board. Part of the process is knowing the constraints and discovering the limitations that allow for a miniature design to fits comfortably into a miniature package.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>Part of the manufacturing process involves optimization techniques. Pictured below are changes made in revisions that reduce the amount of material used in an additive process and decrease the amount of material removed in a subtractive process. Increase the size of the wood to perform less work while on the CNC machine and decrease the size and coverage of the black plastic button holders to reduce cost.</p>
        
        <img src="turntouch-revisions.jpg" class="u-max-full-width photo">        
        
        <p>All of the wood is pattern matched. This means that individual pieces are cut from the same board and are then ensured to be assembled together in the same configuration before they were machined. This creates a beautiful pattern on the buttons and the case which must be accounted for during the machining process.</p>

        <p>Making a museum quality product means making hundreds of prototypes in the pursuit of perfection. Turn Touch involved many messy prototypes, each of which pushed the envelope of what was achievable and what was known to work. Building up enough of these little victories, even on a prototype that was not usable as a final piece, gradually created a process with a high yield and low margin of error.</p> 
        
        <img src="turntouch-prototypes.jpg" class="u-max-full-width photo">
        
        <p>Through open-source hardware like Turn Touch, I’m working to lower the barrier to entry when it comes to creating and manufacturing your own complex hardware devices. Sure, it’s not what you might call a “traditional business plan”. But I strongly believe that by helping other people use the same tools I use, our community of makers gets larger and more inventive.</p>

        <h2>NewsBlur</h2>
    
        <img src="newsblur-devices.png" class="u-max-full-width hero">
        
        <p>NewsBlur is a mature RSS news reader that I've worked on for nearly a decade. It's quite popular, especially since Google sunset Google Reader in 2013. The design process for NewsBlur involved user research, ongoing user feedback, designing for multiple platforms (web, iOS, and Android), and a deep technical dive into the many technologies that make a real-time, continuously updated news reader work.</p>
        
        <p>My role was expansive and full stack. The backend consisted of distributed feed fetchers written in python, capable of fetching and processing 100 RSS feeds a second every single second of the day. The web frontend was <a href="http://ofbrooklyn.com/2012/11/13/backbonification-migrating-javascript-to-backbone/">built in JavaScript using Backbone.js</a> and went through <a href="http://blog.newsblur.com/post/50689286246/the-newsblur-redesign">two major design iterations</a>. The iOS app and the Android app are tightly integrated and present a consistent and synchronized user interface for readers.</p>
        
        <p>The problem that NewsBlur is intended to solve is that well-informed readers of the news have to do a lot of work to stay on top of journalism and writing. Readers have to visit individual websites, which is tedious and leads to a vicious cycle of endlessly refreshing and revisiting websites, or rely on news stories shared over social media, which holds readers hostage to filter bubbles. An RSS news reader like NewsBlur is designed to offer control and advanced customization while still retaining the ease of use of reading news sites directly.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>One powerful way to keep track of multiple news sources is to filter out the stories on subjects you don't want to read while highlighting the stories you do. Rather than asking the user to set complicated filter rules, I designed a trainer, pictured above to the left, that automatically categorized stories, authors, and subjects into easily clickable/tapable thumbs up and thumbs down controls. Using this flexible system gave users an advanced level of control with a minimal amount of work.</p>
        
        <p>Above, pictured center, is a statistics dialog that gave insights into how often news sources were being updated. This is tied into an organizer that lets people cull and manage news sources, offering users a high level overview of their subscriptions.</p>
        
        <p>On the right is the aggregated training data, condensed and displayed to users to see how a news source is viewed by other readers. This gives insights into the news reading experience that reader would not otherwise experience. By knowing what's popular and what's disliked, users can make better adjustments to their own news subscriptions and training filters.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, when more than one person places their hand upon the pulse sensors, the stem starts to pulse with both participants’ heartbeats, making it possible to watch how heart rates of diffrent people in intimate spaces start to beat in sync, much like fireflies flashing in patterns.</p>

        <p>Here’s how Grove works: you sit down at the base of a tree and a flower opens up in front of you as it senses your presence. As you breathe into a pink flower lit from inside, the tree fills up with your breath, rising white streams overtaking multiple slowly descending green lines. As you breathe, the tree shimmers with light as it becomes a nighttime desert oasis.</p>
